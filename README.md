Like Button plugin for Wordpress

There are lots of Like button plugins for wordpress, those do amazing things, but most of them either use another social network to store the likes, or too complex for a beginner who wants to have **just a like button** in their posts and let users like it. Liketon does that.


I am working on this project since the beginning of april but I had midterms and other projects, it was hanging on board for the last 2 weeks now I had the time to update.

It is not finished, like statistics page still needs some **development**.
